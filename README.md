### User Story

<br>

<br>

<hr>

### Purpose
The purpose of this application is to research Magic the Gathering cards in order to build decks, sell cards, research statistics and to search card artwork by artist.

### Why you should care
Even if Magic is not of interest to you it is a good opprotunity to learn about something new. Anazlying statistics and doing quick, simple math is an incredible way to keep your mind sharp (which is important to coding and developing in general). Another reason to you should care about this is becuase it demonstrates how you can find tech opprotunitites in the most unlikely of places. Opprotunity is waiting around every corner when it comes to coding. Searching in places you may not find interesting may be your key to landing your first job or just picking up a new hobby.
